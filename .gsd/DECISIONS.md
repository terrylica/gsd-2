| # | When | Scope | Decision | Choice | Rationale | Revisable? |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| D001 | M001 | arch | Verification gate implementation | Built-in hardcoded in auto.ts handleAgentEnd, before user hooks | Simpler than adding "built-in" hook concept to hook engine. No risk of user disabling it. Clear separation from user hooks. | Yes — if hook engine gets "built-in" profiles |
| D002 | M001 | arch | Verification evidence format | Dual: markdown table in summary + T##-VERIFY.json alongside | Markdown for human readability, JSON for machine querying. Both needed. | No |
| D003 | M001 | convention | Verification command discovery order | Explicit preference → task plan verify field → package.json scripts | Preference override gives control. Auto-detect from package.json is ergonomic fallback. | No |
| D004 | M001 | arch | Runtime error severity classification | Crashes/unhandled rejections block gate. console.error/deprecation logged but non-blocking | Prevents false failures from third-party noise while catching real crashes. | Yes — if false negatives prove common |
| D005 | M001 | convention | Auto-fix retry count | 2 retries (configurable via verification_max_retries preference) | Most failures fixable in 1-2 attempts. More than 2 wastes tokens on genuinely broken code. | Yes — preference-controlled |
| D006 | M003 | arch | Deploy-and-verify target | Vercel first (not Railway) | Aligns with actual workflow. Vercel CLI already installed. | Yes — when second provider needed |
| D007 | M002 | arch | browser_verify_flow location | General browser-tools extension, not GSD-specific | Reusable outside GSD. Consistent with browser-tools extension architecture. | No |
| D008 | M002 | arch | RUNTIME.md authoring | Auto-generated during planning from project analysis | User doesn't manually author. Agent infers from package.json, docker-compose, etc. | Yes — user can override |
| D009 | M004 | arch | Supervisor upgrade scope | Bounded diagnostics (heuristic-based), not full LLM reasoning pass | Lower cost, sufficient for immediate needs. LLM pass deferred to R019. | Yes — upgrade when heuristics prove insufficient |
| D010 | M002 | arch | browser_verify_flow input format | Structured step arrays (like browser_batch with assertions and retry) | Deterministic and replayable. Natural language would sacrifice reliability. | No |
| D011 | M002 | convention | Executable UAT step location | Inline in S##-UAT.md with structured `## Executable Checks` section | Keeps everything in one file. No separate flow file to manage. | Yes — if flow files prove useful |
| D012 | M002 | arch | UAT process teardown | Kill all bg-shell processes started for UAT after completion | Clean state. No leftover processes. User can restart if needed. | No |
| D013 | M002 | arch | RUNTIME.md scope | General-purpose: web apps, CLI tools, daemons, non-HTTP services | User's projects span diverse stack types. Web-only would be too narrow. | No |
| D014 | M002 | arch | browser_verify_flow failure artifacts | Full debug bundle (screenshot, console, network, HAR) | Maximum diagnostic value on failure. Cost is justified when something breaks. | No |
| D015 | M003 | convention | PR body content | Milestone summary directly as PR body | Includes all slice summaries, decisions, evidence. No separate PR-specific format. | Yes — if PR bodies prove too long |
| D016 | M003 | arch | Vercel deploy mechanism | Explicit vercel CLI deploy (not push-triggered) | Doesn't depend on Vercel git integration. More control over environment. | No |
| D017 | M003 | arch | Vercel deploy environment | Preview by default. Production requires explicit preference override. | Safety — never accidentally deploy to production. | No |
| D018 | M004 | arch | Supervisor recovery session | Same session injection (not fresh session) | Preserves in-session state. Lower overhead. | Yes — if fresh sessions prove more effective |
| D019 | M004 | arch | Supervisor diagnostic signals | Heuristic signals + brief activity summary | Activity summary gives richer recovery context than heuristics alone. Worth the small latency cost. | No |
| D020 | M004 | arch | Supervisor escalation path | Pause with structured diagnostic report | User sees what was tried, what was found, supervisor's assessment. Better than silent skip. | No |
